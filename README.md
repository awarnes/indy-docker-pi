This _will be_ a dockerized version of the [hyperledger-indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) self-sovereign identity project.

It will consist of:
- a basic react app working as a front end for interaction with the ledger and people's wallets.
- the hyperledger-indy system (blockchain to record all transactions)
- an api to connect the react app and the indy system

This is a fun system to play around with SSI ideas and see where we can take this amazing technology.
